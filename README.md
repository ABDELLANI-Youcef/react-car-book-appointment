- Jest;
- Create React App;
- React Hooks;
- React Router
- Active Storage
- Linters ( eslint and stylelint)

## How to use the application

In this Application, on the home page, the user gets the informations about the COVID-19 statistics (cases, deaths, and recoveries). The user can use the filter form to change the results to be shown. If the user wants to get more details about a specific country, he can click on the name of that country in order to access a page of details. There he finds the information about the country:
- the capital of the country;
- the population in the country;
- the number of confirmed cases;
- the number of deaths due to COVID-19;
- the number of recoveries from COVID-19;
- the increase in the number of cases in the last 30 days;
- the increase in the number of deaths in the last 30 days.
